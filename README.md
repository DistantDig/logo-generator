  ## Installation

  To use this project, the user must clone the repository down to their local machine from the Github repo. From there, the user must ensure they have navigated to the source folder of the project. Once in the source folder, type 'npm i' to install all of the needed dependencies.

  ## Usage

  Once the application has been installed properly, the user can then navigate to the source folder of the project and run the command 'node index.js' to begin the question prompts. The user can then answer each of the questions that will then determine their final logo. Once all of the questions have been answered, a  new file named 'logo.svg' will be generated in the folder. This will be the user's logo file.
